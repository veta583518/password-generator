# password-generator

## Description

The purpose is to create an application that can be used to generate a random password based on criteria selected by the user.

### Key Points
* Prompt user to ask for password length
* Display an alert if user inputs an invalid response
* Prompt user to ask questions about which characters to use such as uppercase, lowercase, numbers, & special characters
* Validate that at least one criteria was selected.
* The app will then generate a random password using the criteria selected by user.
